# Achieving different message guarantees in Kafka

## 1. At Most Once

- **Example**: Simple UDP-based communication or Kafka without retries or acknowledgments enabled.
- **Implementation Techniques**:
  - Do not use retries or acknowledgment mechanisms.
  - Send messages and assume they are delivered without confirmation.
  - Use non-persistent storage (e.g., in-memory) for fast, best-effort transmission.

---

## 2. At Least Once

- **Example**: Kafka with retries and acknowledgment enabled but no deduplication.
- **Implementation Techniques**:
  - **Message Retries**: Automatically resend messages if no acknowledgment is received.
  - **Persistent Storage**: Store messages in a durable log (e.g., Kafka topics or message queues) until confirmation.
  - **Acknowledgments**: Require confirmation from the consumer that the message was successfully processed.
  - Accept potential duplication due to retries.

## 3. Exactly Once

- **Example**: Kafka with idempotent producers and transactional semantics enabled.
- **Implementation Techniques**:
  - **Idempotent Writes**: Ensure that repeated messages produce the same result (e.g., unique transaction IDs).
  - **Deduplication**: Use unique message IDs to identify and discard duplicates.
  - **Transactional Systems**: Use atomic commit protocols (e.g., two-phase commit) to ensure a message is processed exactly once.
  - Kafka achieves this using a combination of producer idempotency and transaction log coordination.

## 4. Best Effort

- **Example**: Fire-and-forget message sending in Kafka or simple HTTP requests without retries.
- **Implementation Techniques**:
  - Do not implement retries, acknowledgments, or ordering mechanisms.
  - Focus on speed and simplicity, prioritizing throughput over reliability.
  - Use ephemeral message storage.

---

## 5. Ordered Delivery

- **Example**: Kafka’s partitions guarantee order within a single partition.
- **Implementation Techniques**:
  - **Partitioning**: Use a partitioning key to ensure messages in the same partition are delivered in order.
  - **Sequence Numbers**: Include sequence numbers in messages to maintain order during processing.
  - **FIFO Queues**: Employ FIFO queues like those in AWS SQS to ensure strict ordering.

---

## 6. Causal Delivery

- **Example**: Distributed databases like Cosmos DB, which ensure causal consistency in operations.
- **Implementation Techniques**:
  - **Vector Clocks**: Use vector clocks to track causality among messages.
  - **Happens-Before Relationships**: Ensure that if one message causally depends on another, it is delivered afterward.
  - **Application Logic**: Implement causal ordering logic at the application level if not supported natively.

---

## 7. Durable Delivery

- **Example**: Kafka stores messages on disk until they are consumed.
- **Implementation Techniques**:
  - **Persistent Logging**: Store messages in a durable medium (e.g., disk-based log) to survive system failures.
  - **Replication**: Duplicate messages across multiple nodes to handle hardware or network failures.
  - **Acknowledgments with Persistence**: Wait for confirmation that a message is stored persistently before considering it delivered.
