# Components of Kafka

Kafka, developed by Apache, is a distributed event-streaming platform designed to handle real-time data feeds with high throughput and low latency. Below is a summary of its architecture and underlying principles:

## Key Components of Kafka Architecture

`1.` **Topics**:

- Kafka organizes messages into categories called **topics**.

- Each topic is split into **partitions**, which enable parallelism by allowing multiple consumers to read from different partitions of the same topic.

`2.` **Producers**:

- Producers are client applications that publish messages to Kafka topics.

- They can specify which partition to send a message to, enabling control over message distribution.

`3.` **Consumers**:

- Consumers subscribe to topics and read messages, typically as part of a **consumer group**.

- Consumer groups allow for scalable and load-balanced consumption. Each message is consumed by one member of the group.

`4.` **Brokers**:

- A Kafka cluster comprises multiple brokers, each of which is a server running Kafka.

- Brokers store topic data and handle requests from producers and consumers.

`5.` **Zookeeper / Kafka Raft (KRaft)**:

- **Zookeeper** (legacy) was traditionally used for cluster management tasks, such as leader election and maintaining metadata.

- **Kafka Raft (KRaft)** is a newer replacement for Zookeeper, introduced to streamline metadata management and improve fault tolerance.

`6.` **Partitions and Replication**:

- Partitions are distributed across brokers, enabling horizontal scalability.

- Each partition has a leader and replicas (stored on other brokers) for fault tolerance. The leader handles all read and write requests, and replicas sync with it.

`7.` **Logs**:

- Each partition is an immutable log of messages, where new messages are appended.

- Messages are retained for a configurable duration or until storage limits are reached, making Kafka ideal for event replay.

`8.` **Offset**:

- Kafka assigns a unique **offset** to each message in a partition, enabling consumers to track their read progress.

## Core Underpinnings

`1.` **High Throughput and Scalability**

- Kafka achieves high throughput by distributing data across multiple brokers and partitions.

- It supports horizontal scalability by adding more brokers and partitions as demand grows.

`2.` **Fault Tolerance**

- Replication ensures data availability in case of broker failure.

- Consumer offsets are committed, allowing for recovery after crashes.

`3.` **Durability**

- Kafka persists messages on disk and allows them to be replicated, ensuring data durability.

`4.` **Publish-Subscribe Model**

- Kafka supports both traditional queue-like and pub-sub message delivery models.

- It decouples producers and consumers, allowing for independent scaling and development.

`5.` **Backpressure Handling**

- Kafka does not push data to consumers; instead, consumers pull data at their own pace, avoiding overloading.

`6.` **Stream Processing Integration**

- Kafka integrates with tools like Kafka Streams and ksqlDB for real-time processing of streaming data.

## Applications

Kafka is widely used for:

- Real-time analytics.
- Log aggregation and monitoring.
- Event sourcing and messaging.
- Data integration pipelines.

With its robust architecture and underpinnings, Kafka serves as the backbone of data infrastructure for modern distributed systems.
