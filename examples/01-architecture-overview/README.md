# Application Architecture Overview

Classical application architectures describe common structures and patterns for organizing the components of an application. These architectures define how different parts of a system interact and communicate to achieve the desired functionality. Below are some widely recognized classical application architectures:

---

## 1. **Monolithic Architecture**

- **Description**: The application is built as a single, unified unit where all components (e.g., UI, business logic, and data access) are tightly coupled.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Single codebase.
  - All components deployed together.
  - Harder to scale horizontally.
  - Tight coupling can lead to challenges in maintaining and updating.

---

## 2. **Client-Server Architecture**

- **Description**: Divides the application into two parts:
  - **Client**: Handles user interface and user input.
  - **Server**: Manages data processing, logic, and storage.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Centralized server for data and logic.
  - Clients send requests; servers respond with data.
  - Popular for web and desktop applications.

---

## 3. **Layered Architecture (n-Tier Architecture)**

- **Description**: Organizes the application into layers, each with specific responsibilities.
  - Common layers: Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access, Database.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Clear separation of concerns.
  - Easy to understand and maintain.
  - High dependency between layers can be a drawback.

---

## 4. **Microservices Architecture**

- **Description**: Breaks down the application into small, independent services, each focused on a specific functionality.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Services communicate via APIs (e.g., REST, gRPC).
  - Easier to scale and maintain specific services.
  - Requires complex orchestration and monitoring.

---

## 5. **Event-Driven Architecture**

- **Description**: Components interact through asynchronous event notifications.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Reactive and highly decoupled.
  - Suitable for real-time systems (e.g., IoT, stock trading).
  - Complexity in event handling and debugging.

---

## 6. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**

- **Description**: Builds the application as a collection of loosely coupled services, often managed through a central service bus.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Services can be reused across applications.
  - Communication typically via protocols like SOAP or REST.
  - Similar to microservices but with coarser-grained services.

---

## 7. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**

- **Description**: Each node (peer) acts as both a client and a server.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Decentralized control.
  - Common in file-sharing and blockchain systems.
  - Scalability depends on the number of participating peers.

---

## 8. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**

- **Description**: Separates the application into three components:
  - **Model**: Manages data and business logic.
  - **View**: Handles UI representation.
  - **Controller**: Processes user inputs and updates the Model and View.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Promotes separation of concerns.
  - Common in web frameworks (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails).

---

## 9. **Serverless Architecture**

- **Description**: Application logic is deployed in the form of functions, executed on-demand in a cloud environment.
- **Characteristics**:
  - No need to manage infrastructure.
  - Scales automatically based on demand.
  - Cost-effective for infrequent or variable workloads.

---

## 10. **Component-Based Architecture**

- **Description**: The application is built from reusable, self-contained components.
- **Characteristics**:
  - High reusability and modularity.
  - Often used in GUI-based systems and modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Angular).

---

These architectures can be used individually or combined, depending on the application's complexity, scalability requirements, and business goals.
